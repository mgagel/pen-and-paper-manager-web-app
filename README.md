# Introduction to the WWW - Pen and Paper Manager Web App

This group project was created for the Course "Introduction to the World Wide Web" at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg. The repository contains the code for a web application that helps dungeon masters of tabletop role-playing games manage fighting scenes. It is possible to upload and edit a battle map, create monsters and heroes, and manage the corresponding creature data with automated damage and armor calculations. The rules of the German role-playing system [Das schwarze Auge](https://ulisses-spiele.de/spielsysteme/das-schwarze-auge/) in the 5th edition are used.

## How to use

The repository contains an Elm project. To execute the web app, you have to run Elm Reactor in the repository and then open http://localhost:8000/index.html in your browser. It is also possible to view the prototype [here](https://skranz0.github.io/pen-and-paper-manager-web-app/) on GitHub Pages.
